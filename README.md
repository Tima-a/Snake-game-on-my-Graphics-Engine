# Snake game
This is a snake game on my own Graphics Engine I made in 2020.
It is fully made from scratch, with green snake chasing blue fruits and simple counter.
Game is over when snake's head touches its tail.

Demonstration of Snake game, it is not fully perfect as it was just an early project I made for fun.
